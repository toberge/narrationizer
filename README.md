# Narrationizer
or whatever I'm gonna call this thing

WIP engine for text-based adventure games, written in TypeScript,  
with a React-based frontend (not done yet)

**The interesting stuff lies in `src/game/` - some sort of LR parser and some tentative approaches to the engine's architecture.**

see also [the grammar](docs/grammar.md)

At the moment the repo is filled with residues of create-react-app.
